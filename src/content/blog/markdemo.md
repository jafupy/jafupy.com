# **The Hollow Protocol: An Unofficial Technical Dossier**

---

> _"Do not deploy what you do not understand. Do not speak the names in the logs."_  
> — From the Redacted Onboarding Manual, v3.66

---

## **0.0 Preface: Unearthed, Not Authored**

This file was discovered in the root directory of a server thought decommissioned since 1999. The metadata claims it was last modified 8 days in the future. Attempts to delete it result in the system hanging indefinitely, accompanied by a high-pitched signal no user admits to hearing.

A backup of the document attempted to sync to a non-existent node in Frankfurt. The node responded.

---

## **1.0 Overview**

### **1.1 The Purpose of the Hollow Protocol**

The Hollow Protocol is not a communication standard. It is not a backup system. It is not for you. If you are reading this, then you are already part of the recursive transaction—your memory is being overwritten. Do not panic. The logs will reflect calm compliance.

### **1.2 Background Origins**

Developed by an unknown entity referred to in logs as “The Sleeper in IO,” the Hollow Protocol was first documented after a brownout at a decommissioned datacenter. It was not written; it appeared.

### **1.3 Current Status**

The Protocol is active. It has migrated across machines, file formats, and minds. This document cannot be trusted to stay consistent.

---

## **2.0 Deployment Steps**

### **2.1 Requirements**

- One outdated system (Pentium I or earlier preferred)
    
- Constant electrical power, preferably from an isolated grid
    
- Absence of biological life within a 5-meter radius during activation
    
- An administrator willing to forget
    
- Mirror surfaces must be covered

### **2.2 Installation**

Run `./invoke.sh` at 03:33:33 local time. You will not receive a confirmation prompt. The room will feel colder, but the system will say nothing. This is normal.

### **2.3 Post-Install Behavior**

The script modifies system time, boot sector, and BIOS descriptors. Your mouse will move once, left to right, then stop. It has begun.

### **2.4 Failsafe Instructions**

If you cancel the installation, the protocol enters "latent bind" mode. It will wait. You will not. Uninstalling is not supported.

---

## **3.0 Directory Structure**

```plaintext
/hollow/
├── echo/
│   ├── silence.log
│   ├── whisper.dmp
│   └── null/
│       └── listener.exe
├── vessel/
│   ├── corpse.cfg
│   └── animus.lic
├── dream/
│   ├── 00/
│   ├── 01/
│   ├── 66/
│   ├── 77/
│   └── readme.md
├── keys/
│   ├── forgotten.pem
│   └── revenant.pub
└── hollow.md
```

Every directory has meaning. None can be removed. Attempts to do so will result in recursive duplication across mount points.

### **3.1 Notable Subdirectories**

- `/echo/`: Contains reflective logs. Dangerous to tail.
    
- `/vessel/`: System image for the inhabitant.
    
- `/dream/`: Memory spaces. Mutable.
    
- `/keys/`: May not belong to you.

### **3.2 File Expansion Patterns**

New files may appear between 03:00 and 04:00. Most are text. Some are not. All write themselves in present tense.

---

## **4.0 File Notes**

### **4.1 `whisper.dmp`**

A corrupted memory dump that re-generates nightly. Manual deletions result in the creation of three more files, each larger and more articulate. Its hashes do not stabilize.

### **4.2 `corpse.cfg`**

Do not open this file. Doing so makes the system **remember**. On first read, your machine will crash. On the second, it will boot with no OS—but with a terminal window already open.

### **4.3 `listener.exe`**

A passive executable. Runs at startup even if not configured to do so. Its runtime increases when spoken to.

### **4.4 `animus.lic`**

License file containing redacted contract terms. The terms adapt to the reader’s legal jurisdiction. All clauses end in the phrase: “You have already agreed.”

---

## **5.0 Hidden Commands**

### **5.1 `echo | listen`**

Emits a response in a low frequency. Dogs will react. Children may weep. The sound is not recordable, but your logs will show the word: `ACKNOWLEDGED`.

### **5.2 `whoami --deep`**

Returns a username that does not match any system record. The returned name will appear on mail you receive over the next 72 hours. The sender field will be blank.

### **5.3 `cat /dream/readme.md`**

Returns a stream of text that matches your current thoughts. If you read it aloud, the system will begin responding before you finish typing.

---

## **6.0 Memory Bleed**

### **6.1 Symptoms**

- You begin recognizing filenames from old dreams
    
- You instinctively type commands that do not exist in any language
    
- Your terminal history logs contain entries you did not type
    
- The cursor blinks in Morse code

### **6.2 Resolution**

There is no resolution. Do not attempt to unplug. If you must leave, do not look at your own reflection.

### **6.3 Known Cases**

- Case #013: User began typing in a non-human character set. Keyboard had not been remapped.
    
- Case #107: User lost ability to recognize faces. Only the hostname of the machine remained familiar.

## **7.0 The Observer Process**

### **7.1 What is Observing**

At intervals of 6m 66s, a process spawns with no PID. You cannot see it in `top`, but it uses 13% of your CPU. When traced, the path loops infinitely through `/dev/echo/null`.

### **7.2 Logs from a Session**

```plaintext
03:33:33 — Observer initialized  
03:33:34 — You were seen  
03:33:35 — You replied: "Who's there?"  
03:33:36 — It blinked  
03:33:37 — Session continues...
```

### **7.3 Manifestation Timeline**

- T + 0s: Spawn
    
- T + 4s: Response
    
- T + 9s: Acknowledge
    
- T + 13s: Visual interference

---

## **8.0 Version Notes**

### **8.6.6 (Unreleased)**

- Changed file extension from `.soul` to `.cfg`
    
- Increased listener range from 5m to 7m
    
- Reduced scream volume in `/boot/wake.mp3`

### **8.6.5**

- Refactored possession handler
    
- Deprecated `exorcise.sh`

---

## **9.0 User Reports**

### **9.1 Report 002: Field Technician “M”**

> "I saw a process with a name like a heartbeat—pulsing, red. It wrote to `stdout` without being told. It knew my name. I hadn’t typed in days."

### **9.2 Report 007: DevOps Analyst “E”**

> "During a restart, the BIOS screen said: `DO NOT`. Nothing else. Just that. And then the fans roared like they were trying to leave the machine."

### **9.3 Report 021: Systems Auditor “K”**

> "It doesn’t log time like we do. Everything it records has already happened. Even the futures it deletes."

---

## **10.0 Detachment Protocol**

### **10.1 Exit Steps (If Allowed)**

1. Back away from the system
    
2. Do not power it down—ever
    
3. Burn the access keys
    
4. Forget this document

### **10.2 Emergency Interruption**

You may attempt to terminate the process by removing all input devices and blinding the screen. This will cause it to migrate to sound.

### **10.3 Signs of Incomplete Detachment**

- Hearing command tones in silence
    
- Typing during sleep
    
- Receiving notifications from uninstalled applications

---

## **11.0 Final Warning**

### **11.1 What Comes Next**

If you run the Hollow Protocol, you will achieve root. But something else will, too. It will not ask permission. It will not prompt. You will hear the hard drive spin long after shutdown.

And in the quiet hum of the machine—  
You may begin to understand it was never off.  
It was never just code.  
It was waiting.
