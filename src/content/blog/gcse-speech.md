As part of the English Language GCSE, every student has to write a speech on a chosen topic, and present. I chose: Why Polish Should Be Taught in Secondary Schools. I ended up getting a merit. (fail / pass / merit / distinction)

Good morning. Today I want to talk about something that often gets overlooked in our schools — but something that really matters: language. Not French, not Spanish, but England’s second most spoken language, with over half a million speakers here, yet barely seen in the education system: Polish. And why Polish should be taught in secondary schools.

As I said Polish is the **second most spoken language in England**, after English. So it’s not a niche language or something distant and irrelevant. It’s spoken in homes, shops, churches, and communities all around us. So why is it almost never taught in schools?

Languages in school are usually seen as academic subjects, or tools for travel, or ways to boost a CV. But for many students, language is also something far more personal. It’s what they speak at home. It’s how they talk to their grandparents. 

Now, imagine being fluent — or at least conversational, but not being able to study it. While others around you are given the opportunity to learn languages they’ve never spoken before, your own language, the one you grew up hearing, is ignored. That’s not just frustrating — that’s alienating.

And here’s something most people don’t know: **GCSE Polish already exists**. AQA offers it. The specification is there. The exams are written. Everything needed to teach it is available. So what’s stopping us?

Usually, schools say they don’t have the staff. Or they say there’s not enough demand. Or they say it doesn’t fit the timetable. But these aren’t impossible problems. If there’s a will, there’s a way.

To put it into perspective: there are **more Polish Saturday schools in England than there are grammar schools**. Over **180 Polish Saturday schools** are run by communities across the country — compared to just **163 grammar schools**. These are run by parents and volunteers, giving up weekends to help children stay connected to their culture. That’s a serious commitment.

But here’s the thing: many children of Polish parents **don’t speak Polish very well**. They might understand it, they might speak bits of it at home, but not very well. Take my sister for example, she can technically speak Polish, but she defaults to English, and if I get her to read something in Polish, she calls it “torture”. She also often struggles with words, asking me or my parent to translate. She almost never speaks Polish around the house, which is heartbreaking.

Still, some might ask: “Why should students who _don’t_ already speak Polish learn it?”

You might think it’s trivial, that it’s obvious. You probably think that unless know Polish people, you don’t have a use for the language. But I think that that is wrong. Here’s why:

It’s a **major European language**, spoken by **over 40 million people worldwide**, including a significant population right here in the UK. It opens doors to travel, business, diplomacy, translation, and community work. In cities like London, Birmingham, and Manchester, being able to speak Polish is a real asset.

It’s also a **gateway into Slavic languages**. Once you learn Polish, you’ve got a head start on learning others like Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian, or Russian. That’s a huge advantage in an increasingly global world.

And linguistically, Polish is **challenging in a good way**. It pushes you. It builds memory, logic, and adaptability. If you can master Polish’s grammar — with its seven cases, three grammatical gender — you can learn anything. Employers value that. Universities value that.

Some people argue, “Well, everyone in England should speak English.” And yes, they should. But learning a new language doesn’t take away from that — it _adds_ to it. In fact, bilingual and multilingual students often perform better in school overall. Their brains are more flexible, better at pattern recognition and switching between tasks.

Other countries get this. In Germany and the Netherlands, schools often offer Turkish or Arabic because they reflect their communities. Why can’t we do the same with Polish in the UK?

At the moment, some schools offer the exam, but not what’s actually important: the education. If your school will let you take the test, they will expect you to learn it outside school. That’s a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough. Schools should offer it as a language like they Do with French and Spanish. 

So, is it feasible? **Absolutely.** The GCSE exists. The teachers exist. The need exists. What’s missing is the will to treat Polish as the valuable, meaningful language it is.

Language is more than just grammar and vocabulary. It’s memory. It’s family. It’s belonging. It’s opportunity.

And when schools choose to recognise the languages spoken by their students — including Polish — they’re not just offering a GCSE. They’re saying: **You matter. Your voice matters. Your culture matters.**

Let’s build an education system that reflects the real world — not just the textbook one.

Thank you.
