description: Do I have impostor syndrome? Maybe — but not the textbook kind. Or maybe I have impostor syndrome about having impostor syndrome, like mine isn’t impostor-y enough. My brain hurts…

I'm not sure if this even counts as impostor syndrome, but I don't know what else to call it. If you disagree with this being impostor syndrome, too bad. This is *my flavour* of impostor syndrome, and not everything is cookie cutter.

# Part 1, What is Impostor Syndrome?

Before we get into my weird brain and what might be considered impostor syndrome, first lets look at the definition of Impostor syndrome:

>  Impostor syndrome, also known as **impostor phenomenon** or **impostorism**, is a psychological experience in which a person suffers from feelings of intellectual and/or professional fraudulence. <br>
>  \- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

So what exactly does this mean? Impostor syndrome is when someone feels like a fraud, even if they’re actually skilled or successful. So, someone is good as something, but feels they are bad at something.

# Part 2, What's "My" Impostor Syndrome?

Take my [about page](/about) for example. I have rewritten it many times, and no matter what I write, I'm never happy with it.

I write polish [...] in England. And you might think this is perfectly fine, but I don't like it. I was born and raised in England, but both my parents, and pretty much my entire lineage, is Polish as far as I know. And I don't know how to describe it briefly. "English" doesn't fit, and nor does "Polish," without a massive asterisk (\*) at the end.

In real life, I don't feel like this problem exists, as it doesn't get into conversation often and everyone. understands polish means I grew up in England.

But isn't this just an identity crisis? No. While this is one of my issues, another is part of [this article](/w/2025/my-issues-with-vibe-coding) about why I don't like vibe coding.

My main issue was code foreignness, where you didn't know what the code did, without having to read through it, defeating the point of vibe coding. After writing the article, this isn't a vibe coding issue, but an issue with not writing the code yourself. This isn't vibecoding, this is general working in a team. So I then think, will I not be able to work with others in the same codebase? And I don't know.

One last example I will ramble on about is my now somewhat dead project, where when I was making my CMD - K menu (Site search), I wanted to make this custom indexer and search engine, despite knowing [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) exists. I was originally going to make a custom indexer written in go, then somehow turn that into something Fuse could use when fuzzy searching. Now this isn't a problem in itself, but I was reinventing the wheel, and I was in way over my head, as I naïvely wanted to use this massive project as my hello world for learning [Go](https://go.dev/). Now my search is in fact Fuse.JS, and it works! (after being in the "coming soon" stage all throughout my last redesign)

# Part 3, So What Am I On About?

Basically, I always find issues and reasons to disregard my ideas, due to overthinking, and no sense of worth regarding my work. I don't settle, wanting everything to be pretty much perfect. 

So, thats my somewhat maybe weird flavour of impostor syndrome.
